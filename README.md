# com.paul.editor-toolbox

A collection of useful Editor commands and utilities for Unity3d.

All Editor commands here make use of Unity's [MenuItem] attribute, which makes them available in the toolbar.

A additional feature of the [MenuItem] attribute is that we can assign hotkeys to our commands by going to Edit -> Shortcuts. 

Though it takes a bit of time assigning shortcuts and clearing conflicts, this set of editor commands is designed to be a helpful productivity boost for those who like having a access to a wide range of shortcuts.
