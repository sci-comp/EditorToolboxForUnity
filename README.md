# com.paul.editor-toolbox

A collection of useful Editor commands for Unity3d.

Every script contains a single command, and has no dependencies.

Every command here Unity's [MenuItem] attribute. A neat feature of the [MenuItem] attribute is that we can assign these commands hotkeys through Edit -> Shortcuts. The user must assign hotkeys.
